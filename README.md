# Analyze-Network-Traffic-Using-Wireshark
This project demonstrates the process of capturing and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark. The primary objective was to monitor live network packets, identify different protocols in use, and investigate any potential anomalies within the captured data. Wireshark was installed and configured to capture packets on the active network interface. A capture session was started, during which common traffic such as HTTP, DNS, and TCP handshakes was recorded. Once sufficient data was collected, the capture was stopped, and the packets were filtered using Wireshark’s display filters to isolate specific traffic types for analysis. Key points of focus included identifying the source and destination IP addresses, the ports used, the transport protocols involved, and any signs of suspicious or unauthorized communication. Screenshots of the capture and filter results are included in the repository under the “images” folder for visual reference. This documentation aims to provide a clear overview of the steps taken during the capture process, the findings from the analysis, and the practical use of Wireshark as a network troubleshooting and security analysis tool.
